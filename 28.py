#slicing strings

#you can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

#specify the start index and the end index,
# separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.


#get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included)?

b = "hello, world!"
print(b[2:5])


# the first character has index 0



c = "hi rizwan"

print(c[2:7])
