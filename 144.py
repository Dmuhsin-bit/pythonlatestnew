#you can use the ^ operator
# instead of the symmetric_difference() method,
# and you will get the same result.

#use ^ to join two sets ?

set1 = {"apple","banana","cherry"}
set2 = {"google","microsoft","apple"}

set3 = set1 ^ set2
print(set3)

#the^ operator only allows you to join sets with sets,
# and not with other data types
#like you can with the symmetric_difference() method.
